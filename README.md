# Factor Mimicking Portfolio replication with LASSO
We propose an way to construct Factor Mimicking Portfolios as defined by Teiletche-Jurczenko in "Macro Factor-Mimicking Portfolios".

FMPs give investors exposure to "macro" non-observable and non-investable data, like growth, risk-on/off, and inflation.
